Run this command to test your OS:

qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu cortex-a57 -kernel kernel.elf -nographic

Look for the debug output to see where it hangs.

The issue is likely in one of these functions:
- find_file() or find_free_slot()
- strncpy()
- malloc()
- strcpy()

Based on the debug output we got earlier, it was hanging after "[FS_DEBUG] strlen completed"

Try running it and note exactly which debug message is the LAST one printed.
